### Added
- Initial public release of Kusumi512-Standalone.

(Replace the 0.1.0 entry above with actual past release notes if you have them; otherwise use it as the first release entry and update the date.)

How to use this file
1. Record changes under the `Unreleased` heading as you work.
2. When preparing a release:
   - Move changes from `Unreleased` into a new version heading:
     ## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD
   - Update the date to the release date.
   - Tag the release in git with the same version (git tag -a vx.y.z -m "Release vx.y.z") and push tags.
   - Optionally create a GitHub Release from the tag.
3. Keep entries brief and grouped by the categories above.

Suggested PR checklist for release PRs
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with release entries and date.
- [ ] Bump version in any files that track the version.
- [ ] Add/verify tests for relevant changes.
- [ ] Update README or usage docs if needed.

Maintainer tips
- Prefer small, focused changelog entries (one-liners).
- Use `Unreleased` for work in progress and populate the release section only at release time.
- Automations: you can generate changelog entries from conventional commit messages or release notes tooling if desired.

If you'd like a different format (e.g., autogenerated changelog tooling, or a HISTORY.md instead), tell me which style you prefer and I can adjust.
